# Biomedical_images_first_assignment

This repository contains all the code I've written for the first assignment of the course 'Biomedical Images'. The code is primarily written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and focuses on various image processing techniques such as negative transformation, masking, gamma correction, linear adjustment to optimal window, adjustment to gray percentiles, metadata handling, and histogram analysis.

I created this repository as a reference for myself, in case I need to make changes or consult the code in the future. Feel free to explore and provide feedback.
